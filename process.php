          <h2>Pre-Treatment</h2>
          Our overhead conveyor lines utilize a six-stage wash system capable of surpassing AAMA 2605-5 and ANSI C57.12.28 specifications, which includes Alkaline and Laser Oxide Removal as needed. It is comparable to traditional Iron Phosphate Systems, but uses nanotechnologies to provide pretreatment for many substrates such as; Steel, Aluminum, Copper, Brass, Etc. Chemical titration is controlled automatically. Our pretreatment wash system has been approved through several large OEMs.

          <h2>Curing</h2>
          Stand alone or inline natural gas convection/infrared cure ovens are in place to handle this critical stage of the powder coating process. Powder Manufactures set the specifications, as to the oven temperature and duration of time that any product is in the oven to achieve the desired coating properties for chemical resistance, hardness and UV resistance.<br>
          <br>

          Along with our inline curing oven capabilities, Armour Coatings can accommodate large pieces as well in our Stand-alone system. Please contact us to see our capabilities.
